In a world of socks and shoes,
There lived a pair of dancing blues.
They wiggled toes and tapped their heels,
Doing jigs that gave folks thrills.

But one day, a sneaky cat,
Thought the blues would make a hat.
Tried to pounce and snatch them quick,
But the blues, they made a slick trick.

They hopped away, those clever shoes,
Cat chasing, with a case of blues.
So next time you see shoes in flight,
Remember this tale with all your might!
